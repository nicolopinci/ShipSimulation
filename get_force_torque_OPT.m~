function F = get_force_torque_OPT(omega,delta, fL, fD)
%get_force_torque_OPT This (optimized) function gives the force and the torque as a result.
%   Differently from the non-optimized version, forces and torques are
%   calculated on the basis of the given fL and fD. There is no need to
%   output the low, average and high forces and torques, that correspond to
%   different uncertainties, since it is possible to call this function
%   using different fL and fD to obtain them.
